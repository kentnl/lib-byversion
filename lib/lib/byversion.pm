=head1 NAME

lib::byversion - add paths to @INC depending on which version of C<perl> is running.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.002000

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    PERL5OPT="-Mlib::byversion='$HOME/Foo/Bar/%V/lib/...'"

or alternatively

    use lib::byversion "/some/path/%V/lib/...";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

So you have >1 Perl Installs.  You have >1 Perl installs right?
And you switch between running them how?

Let me guess, somewhere you have code that sets a different value for PERL5LIB depending on what Perl you're using.
Oh you use L<< C<perlbrew>?|http://grep.cpan.me/?q=PERL5LIB+dist=App-perlbrew >>

This is a slightly different approach:

=over 4

=item 1. Set up your user-land PERL5LIB directories in a regular pattern differing only by C<perl> version

    $HOME/Foo/Bar/5.16.0/lib/...
    $HOME/Foo/Bar/5.16.1/lib/...
    $HOME/Foo/Bar/5.16.2/lib/...

=item 2. Set the following in your C<%ENV>

    PERL5OPT="-Mlib::byversion='$HOME/Foo/Bar/%V/lib/...'"

=item 3. Done!

The right PERL5LIB gets loaded based on which C<perl> you use.

=back

Yes, yes, catch 22, C<lib::byversion> and its dependencies need to be in your lib to start with.

O.k. That is a problem, slightly. But assuming you can get that in each C<perl> install somehow, you can load each C<perl>'s user library directories magically with this module once its loaded.

And "assuming you can get that in each C<perl> install somehow" =~ with a bit of luck, this feature or something like it might just be added to Perl itself, as this is just a prototype idea to prove it works ( or as the case may be, not ).

And even if that never happens, and you like this module, you can still install this module into all your C<perl>'s and keep a separate C<user-PERL5LIB-per-perl> without having to use lots of scripts to hold it together, and for System Perls, you may even be fortunate enough to get this module shipped by your C<OS> of choice. Wouldn't that be dandy.

=head1 IMPORT

    use lib::byversion $param
    lib::byversion->import($param)
    perl -Mlib::byversion=$param

etc.

C<lib::byversion> expects one parameter, a string path containing templated variables for versions.

Current defined parameters include:

=over 4

=item C<%V>

This is an analogue of C<$^V> except :

=over 4

=item it should work on even C<perl>s that didn't have C<$^V>, as it converts it from C<$]> with L<version.pm|version>

=item it lacks the preceding C<v>, because this is more usually what you want and its easier to template it in than take it out.

=back

Example:

    %V = 5.16.9

=item C<%v>

This is the same as C<$]> on your Perl.

Example:

    %v = 5.016009

=back

More may be slated at some future time, e.g.: to allow support for components based on C<git> C<sha1>'s, but I figured to upload something that works before I bloat it out with features nobody will ever use.
