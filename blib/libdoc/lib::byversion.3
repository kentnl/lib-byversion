So you have >1 Perl Installs.  You have >1 Perl installs right?
And you switch between running them how?
.PP
Let me guess, somewhere you have code that sets a different value for \s-1PERL5LIB\s0 depending on what Perl you're using.
Oh you use perlbrew? <http://grep.cpan.me/?q=PERL5LIB+dist=App-perlbrew>
.PP
This is a slightly different approach:
.IP "1. Set up your user-land \s-1PERL5LIB\s0 dirs in a regular pattern differing only by perl version" 4
.IX Item "1. Set up your user-land PERL5LIB dirs in a regular pattern differing only by perl version"

\&    PERL5OPT="\-Mlib::byversion=\*(Aq$HOME/Foo/Bar/%V/lib/...\*(Aq"
.Ve
.IP "3. Bam!" 4
.IX Item "3. Bam!"
The right \s-1PERL5LIB\s0 gets loaded based on which perl you use.
.PP
Yes, yes, catch 22, \f(CW\*(C`lib::byversion\*(C'\fR and its dependencies need to be in your lib to start with.
.PP
Ok. That is a problem, slightly. But assuming you can get that in each perl install somehow, you can load each perls user library dirs magically with this module once its loaded.
.PP
And \*(L"assuming you can get that in each perl install somehow\*(R" =~ with a bit of luck, this feature or something like it might just be added to Perl itself, as this is just a prototype idea to prove it works ( or as the case may be, not ).
.PP
And even if that never happens, and you like this module, you can still install this module into all your perls and keep a seperate user\-PERL5LIB\-per\-perl without having to use lots of scripts to hold it together, and for System Perls, you may even be fortunate enough to get this module shipped by your \f(CW\*(C`OS\*(C'\fR of choice. Wouldn't that be dandy.

.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`lib::byversion\*(C'\fR expects one parameter, a string path containing templated variables for versions.
.PP
Current defined parameters include:
.ie n .IP "%V" 4
.el .IP "\f(CW%V\fR" 4
.IX Item "%V"
This is an analogue of \f(CW$^V\fR except :
.RS 4
.ie n .IP "it should work on even perls that didn't have $^V, as it converts it from $] with version.pm" 4
.el .IP "it should work on even perls that didn't have \f(CW$^V\fR, as it converts it from \f(CW$]\fR with version.pm" 4

.PD 0
.ie n .IP "it lacks the preceeding ""v"", because this is more usually what you want and its easier to template it in than take it out." 4

More may be slated at some future time, ie: to allow support for components based on git sha1's, but I figured to upload something that works before I bloat it out with features nobody will ever use.
