NAME
    lib::byversion - add paths to @INC depending on which version of "perl"
    is running.

VERSION
    version 0.001001

SYNOPSIS
        PERL5OPT="-Mlib::byversion='$HOME/Foo/Bar/%V/lib/...'"

    or alternatively

        use lib::byversion "/some/path/%V/lib/...";

DESCRIPTION
    So you have >1 Perl Installs. You have >1 Perl installs right? And you
    switch between running them how?

    Let me guess, somewhere you have code that sets a different value for
    PERL5LIB depending on what Perl you're using. Oh you use "perlbrew"?
    <http://grep.cpan.me/?q=PERL5LIB+dist=App-perlbrew>

    This is a slightly different approach:

    1. Set up your user-land PERL5LIB directories in a regular pattern
    differing only by "perl" version
            $HOME/Foo/Bar/5.16.0/lib/...
            $HOME/Foo/Bar/5.16.1/lib/...
            $HOME/Foo/Bar/5.16.2/lib/...

    2. Set the following in your %ENV
            PERL5OPT="-Mlib::byversion='$HOME/Foo/Bar/%V/lib/...'"

    3. Done!
        The right PERL5LIB gets loaded based on which perl you use.

    Yes, yes, catch 22, "lib::byversion" and its dependencies need to be in
    your lib to start with.

    O.k. That is a problem, slightly. But assuming you can get that in each
    perl install somehow, you can load each "perl"'s user library dirs
    magically with this module once its loaded.

    And "assuming you can get that in each perl install somehow" =~ with a
    bit of luck, this feature or something like it might just be added to
    Perl itself, as this is just a prototype idea to prove it works ( or as
    the case may be, not ).

    And even if that never happens, and you like this module, you can still
    install this module into all your perls and keep a separate
    user-PERL5LIB-per-perl without having to use lots of scripts to hold it
    together, and for System Perls, you may even be fortunate enough to get
    this module shipped by your "OS" of choice. Wouldn't that be dandy.

IMPORT
        use lib::byversion $param
        lib::byversion->import($param)
        perl -Mlib::byversion=$param

    etc.

    "lib::byversion" expects one parameter, a string path containing
    templated variables for versions.

    Current defined parameters include:

    %V  This is an analogue of $^V except :

        it should work on even perls that didn't have $^V, as it converts it
        from $] with version.pm
        it lacks the preceding "v", because this is more usually what you
        want and its easier to template it in than take it out.

        Example:

            %V = 5.16.9

    %v  This is the same as $] on your Perl.

        Example:

            %v = 5.016009

    More may be slated at some future time, e.g.: to allow support for
    components based on "git" "sha1"'s, but I figured to upload something
    that works before I bloat it out with features nobody will ever use.
